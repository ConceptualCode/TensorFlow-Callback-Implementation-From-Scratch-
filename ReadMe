# Custom Callback in TensorFlow MNIST Training

This repository contains a TensorFlow project that demonstrates the implementation of a custom callback during the training of the MNIST dataset. The custom callback is designed to monitor the accuracy during training and stop the training process once a certain accuracy threshold is reached.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- TensorFlow (version 2.0 or above)

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

The `train_mnist function` is the code for training the MNIST dataset using a custom callback. The `myCustomCallback` class defines the custom callback that stops the training process when the accuracy reaches 99%. The `train_mnist` function loads the MNIST dataset, defines a simple sequential model, compiles it, and starts the training process with the custom callback.

The script will start training the model on the MNIST dataset. The training progress will be displayed in the console, and if the accuracy reaches 99%, the training process will be interrupted.
